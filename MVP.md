# A minimum viable product declaration

- A premade character sheet is used as a template for the digital character sheet. Possibility to add character picture is integrated.
- Primary values (or Static values) on the sheet can be filled in and stored (e.g. Str, Dex, Con, HP)
- Secodary values are calculated and displayed (e.g. skill checks, attack bonii, carrying capacity, initiative, saves). The secondary values are highly dependent on classes and their proficiencies and character levels.
- We use https://github.com/adrpadua/5e-database/ for our database.
- Attack rolls, saving throws and skill checks are supported. The system for making these are intuitive, just click on the skill, attack or save the character is making (or maybe on a dice icon next to it) and a roll is made.
- Temporary modifiers such as conditions (blinded, charmed, paralyzed etc.), HP loss and gain, spell enhancements and bonuses can be set and be removed. Setting conditions and managing for example HP, is simplified for users on tablets and phones by adding point and click lists.
- Inventory for equipment, valubles and coins. Inventory can be added or removed, both from the database and custom made ones. Carrying weight is calculated from the inventory.
- Spell management. Known spells, memorized spells, spells used and unused spells are handled. Spell descriptions can be viewed. Players should be noted when the character have slots unused and not be allowed to memorize more than is allowed by the rules. Like the secondary values, known and memorized spells are dependent on class and levels.
- A simple character log/diary. Players can keep notes here. 

# Future functions

- Connection between characters and DM. Possibility to give inventory itmes between the party and DM.
- Export function to maptools so that fresh character tokens can be generated in the program. 
- History logging. Characters could for example be rolled back to a lower level, or obtain the HP progression throught the characters level development. History logging could also be set for inventory, making it possible to check "how long did my character wield that cursed sword?"
- Leveling is possible directly in the character sheet.
- Certain actions that are made often might be worth placing in a "quick panel". Maybe players could bookmark their most used actions (like attack roll) for quick access throught the panel that is more accessible than the action itself on the character sheet.
- Improved log/diary with more functionability. For example, adding headings, chapter organization or something.
