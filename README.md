A digital trapper keeper for your dungeons and dragons 5:th edition character. An android app that manages your character's statistics, equipment, feats, spellbook, notes and combat dice rolls. The application will not help you level up your character, it's just a substitute from going from a paper character sheet to a digital one, on your personal tablet or phone.
